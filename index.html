    <h2>Band Bio</h2>

    <p>
        Every Time I Die (abbreviated as ETID) is an American hardcore band from Buffalo, New York, formed in 1998. Currently, they are signed to the record label Epitaph Records. The band was established by Jordan Buckley (Guitars), Andy Williams (Guitars) and Michael Novak (Drums). Jordan's brother, Keith Buckley, was later added on Vocals.

        Their music has been decribed as metalcore, hardcore punk, & post hardcore. They initially formed as a hardcore band but their music soon manifested strong influences from heavy metal and rock. They are strongly influenced by Southern rock; frontman Keith Buckley stated that "the grit of ... Southern rock bands is the one commonality that the band has. It's something we all appreciate and grew up on, in a sense; mainly because it was the type of music that made a coarse poetry out of nature."

    <h2>Why ETID?</h2>

    <p>The band is renown for their energetic and intense live shows. Just as the band's sound is chaotic, sharp and manifold, their lyrics are crafted to be strange, sarcastic and sardonic.</p>
    <p>The video below for their song "The Coin Has a Say" showcases the band's blistering live performances:</p>
